# WooCommerce Driver Assignment

This plugin allows the admin to assign a driver to an order and add driver data to order meta. It creates a new user role called "driver" and adds a driver selection field to the order edit page in the WooCommerce admin panel.

# Usage

Install and activate the plugin
Navigate to the WordPress admin panel and go to the Users tab to add a new user. Select the "driver" role for the user.
Go to the Orders tab and select the order you want to assign a driver to.
Under the billing address, you will see a "Assign Driver" field. Select the driver you want to assign to the order from the dropdown list.
Click "Save Order" to save the changes.
The plugin will automatically add the driver's name and email to the order meta data once the order is placed.
